                <p>Nutritional Therapy uses up-to-date nutrition science to promote mental and physical health - YOUR health and wellbeing. Nutritional therapy is not an ‘off-the peg’ remedy or set of instructions because:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>it considers you to be entirely unique, down to your biochemistry;</li>
                  <li>it recognises that your body works as a whole – that all your systems are interconnected, and not working in isolation;</li>
                  <li>it aims to uncover the root cause(s) of your health concern. It asks WHY your symptoms have arisen, not how to patch them up.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="_mod_pad-top">To do this requires detective work, using a thorough case history to develop an in-depth understanding of your health. Therefore:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>it is highly personalised to you and tailored your needs.</li>
                  <li>it recognises that nutrition is one of the central pillars of health, with environment, exercise, sleep and stress close behind.</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="_mod_pad-top">Ultimately, Nutritional Therapy seeks to use personalised dietary and life- style analysis and changes to overcome barriers to your body realising its optimal health.</p>

                  <p>This process requires time – our bodies are incredibly complex. It also requires a degree of effort from you.
